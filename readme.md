## Feature:

By using jet substructure variables, we study the sensitivity of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider to pair production of stops that decay to tops or bottoms and higgsinos. In a 100 TeV collider, super-boosted tops or bottoms with transverse momentum of order TeV will be produced abundantly. Therefore, it calls for new strategies to identify them. We will apply a set of simple jet observables, including track-based jet mass, N-subjettiness and mass-drop, to tag the boosted hadronic or leptonic decaying objects and suppress the Standard Model as well as possible SUSY backgrounds.

**The work is done in collaboration with with JiJi Fan, Prerit Jaiswal, and John Shing Chau Leung.**

There are different possibilities for stop quark to decay depending on the model

$\tilde{t} \longrightarrow t + MET \qquad$ (100% stop-bino, 50% stop-higgsino)

\tilde{t} \longrightarrow b + MET \qquad$ (50% stop-higgsino)

We will demonstrate two of the cuts. The first one we demonstrate is the leading jet $p_T$ cut. From the plot below, we can see that supersymmtric (SUSY) tops typically give a large leading jet $p_T$. This is one of the most powerful tools to separate a SUSY signal from Standard Model background.
