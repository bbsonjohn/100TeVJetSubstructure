## Feature:

By using jet substructure variables, we study the sensitivity of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider to pair production of stops that decay to tops or bottoms and higgsinos. In a 100 TeV collider, super-boosted tops or bottoms with transverse momentum of order TeV will be produced abundantly. Therefore, it calls for new strategies to identify them. We will apply a set of simple jet observables, including track-based jet mass, N-subjettiness and mass-drop, to tag the boosted hadronic or leptonic decaying objects and suppress the Standard Model as well as possible SUSY backgrounds.
