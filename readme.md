## Feature:

By using jet substructure variables, we study the sensitivity of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider to pair production of supersymmetric tops (stops) that decay to tops or bottoms and higgsinos. In a 100 TeV collider, super-boosted tops or bottoms with transverse momentum of order TeV will be produced abundantly. Therefore, it calls for new strategies to identify them. We will apply a set of simple jet observables, including track-based jet mass, N-subjettiness and mass-drop, to tag the boosted hadronic or leptonic decaying objects and suppress the Standard Model as well as possible SUSY backgrounds.

**The work is done in collaboration with with JiJi Fan, Prerit Jaiswal, and John Shing Chau Leung.**

There are different possibilities for stop quark to decay depending on the supersymmetry (SUSY) model,

\~{t} → t + MET  (100% stop-bino, 50% stop-higgsino),

\~{t} → b + MET  (50% stop-higgsino).

We will demonstrate two of the cuts. The first one we demonstrate is the leading jet pT cut. From the plot below, we can see that stops typically give a large leading jet pT. This is one of the most powerful tools to separate a SUSY signal from Standard Model background.

Another of a variable that behaves like this is the missing tranverse energy (MET). 

To distinguish between different SUSY models, we have to identify the 50% chance of boosted b-quarks produced stop decays in stop-higgsino model. Here we can use the massdrop variable, which is 1 minus the jet mass without muon divided by jet mass with muon included. As we can see in the following plot, the stop decaying to top, and that to bottom give very different massdrop spectrum.

In the same plot, we also show the dominant SM background. We can see
